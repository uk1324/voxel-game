Making the input system event based makes it a lot hader to write more complex behaviour it is hard and unsafe to pass data to the Action.
I don't know how to pass data to the actions for example the attack action must know the weapon but should it be pased on construction or on every frame.
If on every frame how would that be implemented?

Don't know if the polling system Action should a string or an enum.
An enum is good because it is easy to see what actions a scene has and when removing the action from the enum the errors will show you where it is used.
It also shows error on typos. The problem is that if 2 scenes have different actions sets a multiple definition error might occur.
If I separate the input logic for each scene this error shouldn't happen. But I will just use strings so this doesn't happen.
